/// Decides whether a queued input event is still allowed to be delivered.
///
/// The viewer validates input when it *enqueues* an event on the main thread, then delivers it
/// later on a background queue. Everything can change in between: the user can switch Control
/// off, or select a different display. Delivery re-checked neither, so a click could execute
/// after Control was disabled, or land on the display that was selected a moment ago. Because
/// the cleanup that disables routing is itself queued, it also waited behind exactly the stale
/// events it was meant to cancel.
///
/// A monotonic epoch fixes both. Every admitted event carries the epoch it was admitted under;
/// disabling or switching displays bumps the epoch *synchronously*, so queued work is invalid
/// before the cleanup block is even scheduled and drains as no-ops.
///
/// Lives in SpaceOKit rather than the viewer so it can be tested without a UI: the viewer is an
/// executable target, and a rule this load-bearing should not be exercised only by hand.
