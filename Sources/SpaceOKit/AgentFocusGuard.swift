/// SpaceO never activates an agent application, but an application can activate itself:
/// Chromium does when a page opens a popup window, which also pulls the person onto the agent
/// display's Space and sends their keystrokes to the agent's browser until they notice. The
/// guard follows public activation notifications, remembers the person's most recent
/// application, and when an agent-owned process takes over, re-activates that application with
/// public `NSRunningApplication.activate()` — the recovery teardown already uses. It never calls a
/// private focus API, warps the pointer or changes a Space directly.
///
/// Nothing in SpaceO puts an agent application in front on purpose — the Viewer's human control
/// injects input without activating it — so every agent activation is returned. Ownership is
/// judged by exact process identity, and a restoration counts only when the person's whole
/// route is intact again. A process that keeps re-taking activation stops being restored, so the
/// ordinary breach handling reports it instead of two applications trading the front.
